        <h4 id="item-1">About Tesla</h4>
        <p>Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.
            Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn’t need to compromise to drive electric – that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars. Today, Tesla builds not only all-electric vehicles but also infinitely scalable clean energy generation and storage products. Tesla believes the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the better.
            
            Launched in 2008, the Roadster unveiled Tesla’s cutting-edge battery technology and electric powertrain. From there, Tesla designed the world’s first ever premium all-electric sedan from the ground up – Model S – which has become the best car in its class in every category. Combining safety, performance, and efficiency, Model S has reset the world’s expectations for the car of the 21st century with the longest range of any electric vehicle, over-the-air software updates that make it better over time, and a record 0-60 mph acceleration time of 2.28 seconds as measured by Motor Trend. In 2015, Tesla expanded its product line with Model X, the safest, quickest and most capable sport utility vehicle in history that holds 5-star safety ratings across every category from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Completing CEO Elon Musk’s “Secret Master Plan,” in 2016, Tesla introduced Model 3, a low-priced, high-volume electric vehicle that began production in 2017. Soon after, Tesla unveiled the safest, most comfortable truck ever – Tesla Semi – which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 over a million miles based on fuel costs alone. In 2019, Tesla unveiled Model Y, a mid-size SUV, with seating for up to seven, and Cybertruck, which will have better utility than a traditional truck and more performance than a sports car.
            
            Tesla vehicles are produced at its factory in Fremont, California, and Gigafactory Shanghai. To achieve our goal of having the safest factories in the world, Tesla is taking a proactive approach to safety, requiring production employees to participate in a multi-day training program before ever setting foot on the factory floor. From there, Tesla continues to provide on-the-job training and track performance daily so that improvements can be made quickly. The result is that Tesla’s safety rate continues to improve while production ramps.
            
            To create an entire sustainable energy ecosystem, Tesla also manufactures a unique set of energy solutions, Powerwall, Powerpack and Solar Roof, enabling homeowners, businesses, and utilities to manage renewable energy generation, storage, and consumption. Supporting Tesla’s automotive and energy products is Gigafactory 1 – a facility designed to significantly reduce battery cell costs. By bringing cell production in-house, Tesla manufactures batteries at the volumes required to meet production goals, while creating thousands of jobs.
            
            And this is just the beginning. With Tesla building its most affordable car yet, Tesla continues to make products accessible and affordable to more and more people, ultimately accelerating the advent of clean transport and clean energy production. Electric cars, batteries, and renewable energy generation and storage already exist independently, but when combined, they become even more powerful – that’s the future we want.</p><hr>
        <h5 id="item-1-1">Tesla’s Model S </s></h5>
        <p>The Tesla Model S is an all-electric five-door liftback produced by Tesla, Inc. It was introduced on June 22, 2012. It received a major refresh in June 2021. Tesla positions the Model S as its flagship.

            In 2013, the Model S became the first electric car to top the monthly new-car-sales ranking in any country, leading twice in Norway, in September and December 2013 and in Denmark in December 2015. Sales passed 250,000 units in September 2018. The Model S was the top-selling plug-in electric car worldwide in 2015 and 2016, although it was later surpassed by the Model 3.
            
            In an early review of the Model S, Consumer Reports declared, "This car performs better than anything we've ever tested before. Let me repeat that: Not just the best electric car, but the best car. It does just about everything really, really well." In their Owner Satisfaction survey owners have consistently rated Teslas at, or near, the top rankings. In 2019, Motor Trend named the 2013 Tesla Model S the ultimate "Car of the Year" over the magazine's entire 70-year history.</p><hr>
        <h5 id="item-1-2">Tesla’s Model 3</h5>
        <p>The Tesla Model 3 is roughly the same size as a BMW 3 Series and there are currently three versions to choose from: an entry-level model called simply the Model 3, a Long Range version designed to maximise distances between charges, and a range-topping Performance variant that promises Porsche 911-beating acceleration. 

            In the world of pure electric cars, the closest rival to the Model 3 is the Polestar 2, although you might also find yourself considering the Hyundai Ioniq 5 hatchback, or possibly higher-riding options, such the Audi Q4 E-tron. However, officially at least, the Model 3 can manage a greater distance between charges than any of those alternatives and it can charge up really quickly, too, at one of the abundant Tesla Superchargers dotted around the country.</p><hr>
        <h4 id="item-2">Tesla’s Model X</h4>
        <p>The 2022 Tesla Model X is a prime example of the EV automakers' brand ethos. Quick, high-tech, and featuring a flashy gimmick in its Falcon-wing rear doors, it presents a unique-but-expensive proposition in the growing EV-crossover segment. The Model X comes standard with two electric motors making a total of 670 horsepower and all-wheel drive; a three-motor version called Plaid makes an astounding 1020 horsepower and is said to shoot to 60 mph in just 2.5 seconds. That mega-motor version will be available in late 2022 according to Tesla. The Model X isn't as agile as the mechanically similar Model S sedan, but it's surprisingly agile given its size and weight. The cabin is an exercise in modernism, with a giant screen dominating the dashboard providing touch-sensitive access to most of the Model X's features. A third row of seats provides room for the whole family, and the second row can be ordered with captain's chairs.</p><hr>
        <h4 id="item-3">Item 3</h4>
        <p>...</p>
        <h5 id="item-3-1">Tesla’s Model Y </h5>
        <p>The Tesla Model Y tried to capitalize on the red-hot success of the Model 3, but the all-electric crossover is more fizzle than sizzle. Whereas the Model 3 nails its mission with a handling that dances and impressive range, the 2022 Model Y feels like a lazy effort to appeal to the SUV-buying public. Its handling is less engaging than the 3’s and its cabin—while largely carry-over from the sedan—doesn't do enough to differentiate itself, which serves only to magnify our criticism of both its fit-and-finish and the problems that the all-digital environment creates. It's not entirely without value, though. Its estimated driving range is good compared with rivals such as the Ford Mustang Mach E and the Volkswagen ID.4, and the Long Range trim promises up to 330 miles per charge. Plus, the Tesla is available with an optional third row of seats which is still rare in the world of EVs SUVs.

        <h5 id="item-3-2">Tesla’s Solar Roof </h5>
        <p>Tesla is launching a new solar roof tile with greater efficiency and higher power capacity. It comes as Tesla is trying to make its solar products mainstream.


 
            Tesla has had ups and downs when it comes to the solar roof.
            
            The product has been widely recognized for its beautiful design. It undeniably has significant advantages over regular solar panels, with the ability to penetrate markets like new houses and homes that need a roof replacement relatively soon.
            
            However, it has been hard to bring it to market.
            
            Tesla has had issues testing for longevity, with prices fluctuating widely as the company realized the difficulties of create a streamlined product for such different things as roofs.
            
            As we previously reported, Tesla significantly increased the price of the solar roof tiles earlier this year, after introducing a new “roof complexity factor.”
            
            But the company claimed that the demand for the solar roof was still strong after this price increase, and that installations are accelerating.
            
            Now we learn that Tesla is making a significant upgrade to its solar roof with a new, more powerful, solar tile.
            
            Electrek has obtained a datasheet for the new solar tile that Tesla has started to include in solar roofs designed for customers.
            
            Tesla previously used its “SR60T1” tile, with a 58.5-watt capacity, in solar roof designs.
            
            Now the company is now producing quotes and starting installations with a new “SR72T1” solar tile.
            
            The new tile features a higher max power output of 71.67 watts:</p>
